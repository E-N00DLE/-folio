Inspired by retro consoles and computing, the artist merges modern capability with qualities of years prior. Whether it's through bit-crushed audio, pixel-art resolutions, analog synth tapes, or live performance, E Noodle embraces combining approaches. Throughout this work, they aim to emphasize human aspects within the ever-increasingly computerized world we inhabit.â€‹
