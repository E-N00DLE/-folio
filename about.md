Evan Naud is an electronic musician and interdisciplinary artist based in Atlanta, GA. An enthusiast of experimental creative interaction, their work as E Noodle is an exploration of hardware and software implementation. Originally realized by combining performance of electric bass and synthesizer programming, any process utilizing digital signals and analog equipment is welcome. 

Inspired by retro consoles and computing, the artist merges modern capability with qualities of years prior. Whether it's through bit-crushed audio, pixel-art resolutions, analog synth tapes, or live performance, E Noodle embraces combining approaches. Throughout this work, they aim to emphasize human aspects within the ever-increasingly computerized world we inhabit.â€‹
